IS CORE INTEGRATIVE EXERCISE (INTEX)
FALL 2017

All students who are enrolled in the IS core courses (401, 402, 403, 414) are required to participate in this integrative exercise.  This exercise will consume significant effort from Monday, December 4, 9:00 am until 5:00 pm Friday, December 8.  While we recognize that all of you have other classes and jobs, some more than others, which cannot be ignored, this exercise should merit significant priority during the 5 days.  Peer evaluations will be administered at the end of the exercise to provide feedback on individual effort. 

The following deadlines are important.  All students should attend the presentation and the meetings.

Introductory Meeting:			9 am, Monday, December 4 in W408 TNRB

Project Printed Report due:		12:00 pm on Friday, December 8 in 3rd floor atrium
	No grace period.  Late projects will be penalized.

Presentations given:			1:00-4:00pm Friday, December 8 in assigned rooms.

Debriefing Meeting:			During class the following Monday, December 11.

Online Peer Evaluation Form due:	5 pm Friday, December 8 (submit online in Learning Suite for the IS403 course)  


Each team should study the case, analyze the company and its processes, and prepare an appropriate solution.  The case deliverables should be the following:

	(1) a printed project report (turned in to 3rd floor atrium by Friday, noon)

	(2) a pdf of your project needs to be uploaded to IS 401 Learning Suite (Friday, noon)

  (3) your zipped ASP.NET MVC Project uploaded to the IS 403’s Learning Suite’s INTEX ASP.NET 
	(Friday, noon)

  (4) your hosted website including database to SmarterASP.net (Friday, noon) (Please see tutorials and videos for this on Learning Suite) – please supply web link in your project documentation.

  (5) a pdf of database diagram and sql schema (Friday, noon)	

  (6) a pdf of your project business processes and controls (Friday, noon)	

	(7) a presentation (scheduled Friday afternoon)


You may also provide handouts during your presentation.  If you do so, you will need three copies of the handout materials (given to the evaluation team at the start of your presentation). 
	
As explained in the case, the project report and the presentation are intended to permit the client’s management to make a go/no-go decision on the project. These should include the business case including feasibility justification, project plan for implementation, complete user requirements as systems specifications with all appropriate project documentation, system’s documentation, business processes and controls, a website (with basic functionality), database and accompanying documentation, and other considerations and elements that you deem appropriate.  

The focus of this exercise is on project planning and feasibility analysis, systems analysis, process modeling, data modeling (including conceptual and relational models), and prototyping.  You should implement skills acquired in the IS 401, IS 402, IS 403, and IS 414 courses.  The objective of this activity is to use your knowledge and your creativity in solving a business problem.  Your report should include recommendations for implementing a solution – in other words, the approach you recommend for developing a solution system.  Make sure you include a discussion of any integrity control issues that might be critical (see IS 414 materials). 

The project report should be a professional document reflecting high-quality, professional work.  This report will be read by both upper management as well as the technical staff of the client.  Some of the client’s evaluation committee will only read the executive summary, others will read the report in detail to ascertain if it is correct, complete, and comprehensive.  The report should be easy to understand by both upper management and the technical staff. Remember, you are trying to “sell” your solution to the client so make sure you think carefully and cover all aspects of solving the solution. If in doubt, include it in the project!

The oral presentation should reflect a professional effort with appropriate dress, communications skills, presentation media and techniques, and information systems expertise.  All group members are expected to be present. The presentation will be carefully timed, and for obvious reasons we must hold closely to the schedule.  Clearly, groups should carefully organize their material and PRACTICE their presentation before the designated time period - make it timed, crisp and tight.  Remember, technology is notorious for failing at the worst times, so prepare, test and plan accordingly.  A backup plan for the presentation may be prudent.  Since some members of the presentation audience (i.e. visiting professionals) will not have read your report, provide some summary or highlight information in the form of a handout.  Make three copies – one for each of the three members of the evaluation team.   


IS INTEX PRESENTATION & SCHEDULING INFORMATION

All presentations will be on Friday Afternoon, December 8.

Groups should dress and present at a professional level.  Please arrive 15 minutes before your scheduled time, and be ready to set up when invited in.  Each presentation period will be structured as follows:

	Group Presentation		25 minutes (Student group presents and answers questions)
	Judge Deliberation		5 minutes (Student group waits in the hall)
	Feedback			        10 minutes (Student group is called back into room)
	Break/Setup			      5 minutes (Group exits quickly; next group sets up)



Your project will be evaluated based on both your printed Project Report and your presentation.  The presentation will count for 20 points (out of 100).  The other 80 points will be based on the correctness and quality of your work.  Evaluation of your work will be based primarily from the printed Project Report, but will also be influenced by the details that you provide in your presentation.  The following point assignments apply: 

 
	1.  System Solution – (IS 401)							      20 points
		
	2.  Database Solution – (IS 402)							    15 points
		
	3.  Business Processes and Controls – (IS 414)		15 points
		
	4.  Website Solution – (IS 403)							      15 points
 	
	5.  Project Report  						              		15 points
		  
	6.  Presentation                   								20 points
		

Every presentation room will be equipped with an overhead projector and computer projector. Groups may use their own laptop for any “Power Point” presentation or other software based illustrations.  It is the group’s responsibility to check out functionality in advance.

You will complete an online peer evaluation at the end of the project (due Friday, December 8th by 5 pm). The link will be provided on Learning Suite. The items upon which you will evaluate yourself and your peers are:
1.	Did fair share of work
2.	Cooperative/did agreed upon task
3.	Contributed to ideas/planning
4.	Available for communication
5.	Positive/helpful
6.	Timeliness in the completion of the work
7.	Quality of the work
If you do not complete the peer evaluation, you will have your score lowered. The intent of the peer evaluations is to encourage a fair and positive work environment. Students showing a pattern of lower performance on the peer evaluations may have their scores lowered.
